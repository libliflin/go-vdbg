Go visual debugger wip


Open gl mini windows one per goroutine. 

The debugger would actually just be a go interpreter at the start.

Super hotkey functionality: go to goroutine; run expression; view heap; view break points; view variables; view goroutines referencing chan/mutex/variable. Find active goroutines. Find waiting goroutines. Zoom out and arrange goroutines by creator, by chan, or by time alive. Group/ collapse similar goroutines. 

Light table ish?

Source maps?

Table based variable inspection for loops?  Like Dr. Kreher used to.
